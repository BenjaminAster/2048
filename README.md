### 2048 Game

My version of the 2048 game. You can increase/decrease the size of the field by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Arrow Keys</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> +<kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Arrow Keys</kbd>

Side note: I created this back in August 2020, and my code back then was not very beautiful.
